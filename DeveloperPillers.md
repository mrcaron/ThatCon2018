# 7 pillars of a good career

## Pillar 5 - Happiness

People are drawn to the positive; If we can sell people on the exciting things rather than harp on the negative. See the silver lining3 $ # 7 pillars of a good career

Crotisol: Stress chemical. Endorphins from exercise; work out in the morning to get rocking in a great way. Dopamine from completing a task. Serotonin from helping others. Oxytocin from time with loved ones. Feeling down... one of these chemicals needs a bump. Any of these can be addictive.

Not productive or pleasurable? Stop. Waste time WELL. Go find something pleasurable to do that will hit one of those four key spots. Either "Hell yeah!" or "no". Only say yes to the things that really get you excited.

Productive procrastination. Don't feel like coding now? Choose exercise, hangout, read, write, experiment. This gets thtat dopamine rocking.

## Pillar 2 - Focus

Gym. 30 min 5 days a week. 3 meals a day. No diet. Go talk to the biggest guy at the gym. They pretty consistantly work out 2 hours a day and eat 6 days a week. 4 meals a day. Strict diet. Massive commitment. If you want to be an anomoly, you have to act like one.

We have a lack of focus. Conferences are a big bummer for this. To execute and become exceptional, focus on something. Become boarderline obsessive about ONE thing. Think specializations. Your skill set is a venn diagram. Example:

* React
* Transitioning Teams (from Angular, etc to React)
* Web
* Modern JS Ecosystem

Answer this: "I want to be exceptional at ____". Answer this big time. What life do you want to live?

Book: Essentialism: The disciplined pursuit of less, by Greg McKeown.

Example: Hussein Bolt - born to run. We are all different.

Specialization becomes a necessity as industries mature. You can always drill deeper and deeper. If you list out all your skills, what are the most fun? BE KNOWN FOR THAT. Generalist vs. Specialist: You can brand yourself easier, you can get tons of jobs.

What would you want people to google for to find you? Then start blogging that way, brand yourself.

## Pillar 3 Education

Knowledge doubles. 

Book: Mindset by Carol S. Dweck, Ph. D.; Fixed vs. Growth Mindset. Keep pushing if it's hard, you will get there.

The Caring cycle: You care about something more than other people. You become dedicated to it and that builds mastery, trust and autonomy. So what are you passionate about? (Book: _So good they can't ignore you_ by Cal Newport).

DON'T SPIN YOUR WHEELS in _Just in case_ learning, but spend time on _just-in-time_ learning or fundamentals that will stand the test of time.

Manicure your information stream. gh://CoryHouse/ama

Learn how you learn.

* blogs
* books
* videos
* read code
* class rooms

The Feynman Technique; learn by eaching yourself. Write the concept as heading then explain it like you're trying to teach a 5 year old. Learn one thing at a time. Learn latest JS before you jump into React.

The internet is a massive haystack. SUPER USEFUL to create a smaller haystack. Use OneNote, Gists, Evernote... Cataloge it so that you can go back and FIND IT.

## Pillar 4 Image

We like to believe the world is a meritocracy. Unfortunately it's not. Degree doesn't matter. Dress strategically. Comfort or power? What makes you feel more confident for the tasks you're going to do today? 

I am who I think you think I am. Improve your self image. Try speaking! answer questions, be a guest on podcasts, speak at confs, tweet what you're learning. Make what you're doing more public and you'll get more value.

Increase your visibility:

* attend conferences and user groups
* speak
* startup weekend
* code for charity
* consult
* blog, tweet, speak

## Pillar 1 - Communication

Stereotype that devs are poor communicators. Experts are the ones asking all the right questions. DO NOT become dogmatic. The longer you're coding, the more frequently your answer should be "it depends." Experts ask questions, context matters.

Book: Daniel H. Pink, "To sell is human" - We're all selling ideas. LEARN TO SELL YOUR IDEAS.

Fools argue, wise people discuss.

Book: Cricial Conversations: Tools for talking when things are heated. Argument: When you try to decide _who_ is right; Discussion: When you try to decide _what_ is right.

Keep your identity small; avoid "I am..." and say "Right now, I specialize in...".

Talk money, but not with co-workers. Figure out what independent people are making and shoot for that.

Sit with people you _don't_ know. "May I join you?"... etc. What tech are you in? Where are you going next? What are you learning? Be real though, network with people you like. Recognize those you like.

Book: _How to win friends and influence people_, Dale Carnegie.

Wanna get good at communication, SPEAK. Speak at conferences. It will force you to get better. First, second and 3rd order thinking. Start with a lunch and learn. Then do a local meetup. Then a code camp, followed by regional conferences and then international ones. You get free flights, etc. You start local... move outward.

_Two greatest fears in life are death and public speaking... and the first is public speaking_ : Jerry Seinfeld. You will fail... but it's OK! keep going. You will get better and people will see you get better.

## Pillar 5 Use Money wisely, Buy Time

### Buy Time through task doers

* Get your grass mowed
* Pay the handyman
* ...

### Buy mental bandwidth

* Autopay bills
* Eliminate debt
* Live beneath your means
* Move to a quiet neighborhood

Time perspective...

A few hours "Where do I get my next meal?" vs years "Where is the market headed?". The more you choose to buy time, the more advantage you have. You can't change only one thing. Life is eaten up by many buckets:

* health
* family
* religion
* job
* self development
* civic
* recreation

You CAN multithread your life. Learn while commuting. Learn while exercising. Roughhouse wiht the kids for exercise and family time.

## Pillar 7 Systems

Book: How to fail at almost everything and still win big by Scott adams. Goals have an endpoint systems dont. Goals require willpower systems don't. Goals are all or nothing, systems are not.

| Pillar | System | 
| Communication | Speak, write, read|
| Focus | Go big on smething automate input stream|
|Education| Teach yoursef, then others|
| image| be public|

Success:

* define it
* figure out the price
* pay it

### Define it

WHAT IS YOUR FOCUS? Corey: learn daily, build stuff, share. Automate your input stream so that it comes to you, not you go to it.

### Pay for it

The cost of these things is NO JOKE. You will have to sacrifice to get it done... things like no tv, etc. It's illogical to envy others. We don't know the price they paid. Book: Steve Martin _Born standing up_. Listen to it. He was awful for a long time and slowly got better.

## Review

Success is personal. You won't act on a vague desire. You need to change your system. Be agile... change 1 thing. Plan the one thing you want to change. 

Be at the 1pm open space. Talk money, poltics, etc. Corey's pluralsight talk: _Becoming an outlier Reprogramming..._
