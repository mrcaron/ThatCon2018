## Pillar 5 - Happiness

People are drawn to the positive; If we can sell people on the exciting things rather than harp on the negative. See the silver lining3 $ # 7 pillars of a good career

Crotisol: Stress chemical. Endorphins from exercise; work out in the morning to get rocking in a great way. Dopamine from completing a task. Serotonin from helping others. Oxytocin from time with loved ones. Feeling down... one of these chemicals needs a bump. Any of these can be addictive.

Not productive or pleasurable? Stop. Waste time WELL. Go find something pleasurable to do that will hit one of those four key spots. Either "Hell yeah!" or "no". Only say yes to the things that really get you excited.

Productive procrastination. Don't feel like coding now? Choose exercise, hangout, read, write, experiment. This gets thtat dopamine rocking.

## Pillar 2 - Focus

Gym. 30 min 5 days a week. 3 meals a day. No diet. Go talk to the biggest guy at the gym. They pretty consistantly work out 2 hours a day and eat 6 days a week. 4 meals a day. Strict diet. Massive commitment. If you want to be an anomoly, you have to act like one.

We have a lack of focus. Conferences are a big bummer for this. To execute and become exceptional, focus on something. Become boarderline obsessive about ONE thing. Think specializations. Your skill set is a venn diagram. Example:

* React
* Transitioning Teams (from Angular, etc to React)
* Web
* Modern JS Ecosystem

Answer this: "I want to be exceptional at ____". Answer this big time. What life do you want to live?

Book: Essentialism: The disciplined pursuit of less, by Greg McKeown.

Example: Hussein Bolt - born to run. We are all different.

Specialization becomes a necessity as industries mature. You can always drill deeper and deeper. If you list out all your skills, what are the most fun? BE KNOWN FOR THAT. Generalist vs. Specialist: You can brand yourself easier, you can get tons of jobs.

What would you want people to google for to find you? Then start blogging that way, brand yourself.

## Pillar 3 Education

Knowledge doubles. 

Book: Mindset by Carol S. Dweck, Ph. D.; Fixed vs. Growth Mindset. Keep pushing if it's hard, you will get there.

The Caring cycle: You care about something more than other people. You become dedicated to it and that builds mastery, trust and autonomy. So what are you passionate about? (Book: _So good they can't ignore you_ by Cal Newport).

DON'T SPIN YOUR WHEELS in _Just in case_ learning, but spend time on _just-in-time_ learning or fundamentals that will stand the test of time.

Learn how you learn.

* blogs
* books
* videos
* read code
* class rooms

The Feynman Technique; learn by eaching yourself. Write the concept as heading then explain it like you're trying to teach a 5 year old. Learn one thing at a time. Learn latest JS before you jump into React.

The internet is a massive haystack. SUPER USEFUL to create a smaller haystack. Use OneNote, Gists, Evernote... Cataloge it so that you can go back and FIND IT.

We like to believe the world is a meritocracy. Unfortunately it's not.
